\title{Combined DAA Dataset.}
\format{
A data frame with 26 variables:
\describe{
\item{facilityuid}{The alphanumeric UID used to identify the facility in
DATIM.}
\item{indicator}{The reporting indicator for the DAA.}
\item{period}{The fiscal year reporting period.}
\item{moh}{The results provided for the given indicator by the MOH during
the associated reporting period.}
\item{pepfar}{The results provided for the given indicator by PEPFAR during
the associated reporting period.}
\item{reported_by}{A text value indicating whether results were reported
by just the MOH, just PEPFAR, or both entities at the given site for the
given indicator during the reporting period.}
\item{count_of_matched_sites}{The number of facilities in a country for the
particular indicator and reporting period for which results were reported
by both the MOH and PEPFAR.}
\item{pepfar_sum_at_matched_sites}{The total results reported by PEPFAR
at all facilities in a country for the particular indicator and reporting
period.}
\item{weighting}{The PEPFAR results at the particular facility divided by
the total results reported by PEPFAR at all facilities for the given
indicator and reporting period. This figure provides the weighting value
for concordance and discordance metrics.}
\item{weighted_discordance}{The weighted discordance between the PEPFAR
and MOH reported results at the particular facility. Can be summed across
facilities grouped by country, indicator, and period to calculate the
weighted average discordance.}
\item{weighted_concordance}{The weighted concordance between the PEPFAR
and MOH reported results at the particular facility. Can be summed across
facilities grouped by country, indicator, and period to calculate the
weighted average concordance.}
\item{namelevel3}{The name of the parent organisation unit at hierarchy
level 3 to the given facility.}
\item{namelevel4}{The name of the parent organisation unit at hierarchy
level 4 to the given facility.}
\item{namelevel5}{The name of the parent organisation unit at hierarchy
level 5 to the given facility.}
\item{namelevel6}{For countries with their facility level at hierarchy
level 6, this will represent the name of the facility. For countries with
their facility level at hierarchy level 7, this will represent the parent
organisation unit at hierarchy level 6 to the given facility.}
\item{namelevel7}{For countries with their facility level at hierarchy
level 7, this will represent the name of the facility. For countries with
their facility level at hierarchy level 6, this value will be 'NA'.}
\item{emr_at_site_for_indicator}{Boolean value indicating whether a
facility has an electronic medical records system associated with the
given indicator for that row.}
\item{tx_pvls_n}{The numerator for TX_PVLS, representing the number of
patients with suppressed viral load test results documented in a given
period.}
\item{tx_pvls_d}{The denominator for TX_PVLS, representing the number of
patients with a viral load test result documented in a given period.}
\item{moh_id}{The UID used by the MOH to identify the facility.}
\item{longitude}{Longitude of the facility as recorded in DATIM.}
\item{latitude}{Latitude of the facility as recorded in DATIM.}
